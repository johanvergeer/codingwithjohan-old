Title: Cake
Tags: C#, Cake

This page contains some snippets and links I refer to when I'm creating Cake scripts.
Most of this information can be found on the [Cake website](https://cakebuild.net/),
but this should give a better overview of some things I personally use.

# .gitignore

The  `.gitignore` file should contain the following lines:

```plaintext
tools/*
!tools/packages.config
```

# build.cake content

## Arguments

This defines a `-target` argument which, when omitted, defaults to _Default_

```csharp
var target = Argument("target", "Default")
```

This defines a `-configuration` argument which, when omitted, defaults to _Release_

```csharp
var configuration = Argument("configuration", "Release")
```

## Tasks

A Cake file contains _Tasks_ that we want to execute:

```csharp
Task("Default")
    .IsDependentOn("Dotnet-Core-Package")
```

### CleanDirectory / CleanDirectories

These aliases make sure that the directory or directories exist, and that they are empty.

```csharp
Task("Clean")
    .Does(() => {
        CleanDirectory("./BuildArtifacts");
    });
```

### DotNetCoreRestore

In the example below is `DotNetCoreRestore` an alias, which is running the _dotnet cli_ with the `restore` command.

```csharp
Task("Dotnet-Core-Package")
    .Does(() => {
        DotNetCoreRestore(
            "./src/project/project.csproj",
            new DotNetCoreRestoreSettings {
                PackagesDirectory = "./src/packages"
            }
        );
    });
```

### DotNetCoreBuild

In the next example the `DotNetCoreBuild` is an alias, which is running the _dotnet cli_ with the `build` command.

```csharp
Task("Build")
    .IsDependentOn("Dotnet-Core-Build")
    .Does(() => {
        var settings = new DotNetCoreBuildSettings {
            Configuration = configuration,
            NoRestore = true
        };

        DotNetCoreBuild("./src/project/project.csproj");
    });
```

### DotNetCorePublish

Publish to the local file system.

```csharp
Task("Publish")
    .IsDependentOn("Build")
    .Does(() => {
        var settings = new DotNetCorePublishSettings {
            Configuration = configuration,
            OutputDirectory = "./BuildArtifacts"
        };

        DotNetCorePublish("./src/project/project.csproj", settings);
    });
```

### Aliases

Cake supports something called [script aliases](https://cakebuild.net/docs/fundamentals/aliases). 
Script aliases are convenience methods that are easily accessible directly from a Cake script. 
Every single [DSL method](https://cakebuild.net/dsl/) in Cake is implemented like an alias method. 

## RunTarget

The end of build.cake should contain the following line to run:

```csharp
RunTarget(target);
```

This will make sure the `tools` directory is not included in source control, except for `packages.config`,
which contains the Cake version we're using.

# What is a build?

## Typical build workflow

1. Package restore
2. Clean
3. Unit Tests
4. Test Coverage (NCover, OpenCover)
5. Static analysis
    1. StyleCop
    2. FxCop
    3. DupFinder
    4. InspectCode
6. Package
7. Publish

# Intellisense

To have Intellisense in VS Code for Cake, just run the `Cake: Install Intellisense Support` 
and `OmniSharp: Restart OmniSharp` commands in VS Code.
